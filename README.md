# AI-Coder
This repo documents the "AI Coder" project, which uses AI tools to develop the "A-Life Challenge" simulation. The focus is on documenting the process, including the use and limitations of AI in software development, with code and a developer diary.

## Project Overview
This project, named **"AI Coder"**, explores the use of AI tools in the software development lifecycle. The primary goal is to document and analyze the effectiveness of using AI tools such as **GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others** throughout the entire development process. The project also involves building an "A-Life Challenge" application, which is a secondary goal to the documentation and analysis.

The main deliverable is a comprehensive report on the methods, limitations, and best practices for working with AI tools. This includes documenting "aha" moments and setbacks, and reflecting on how a developer could use these tools in a better way.

## A-Life Challenge
The **"A-Life Challenge"** is a software project that simulates an evolutionary artificial life environment. The simulation should incorporate features such as:
*   Evolving genomes
*   Population dynamics
*   Emergence of complexity from simple rules
*   A visual interface
*   Saving and loading simulations
*   Manual manipulation of the genome
*   Introduction of harsh environmental conditions

The A-Life Challenge will serve as a testbed for exploring how AI tools can aid in the development of complex simulations.

## AI Coder Project Focus
The **primary focus of this project is the documentation and analysis of the AI tools**, rather than the absolute completion of the software project. The documentation should detail:
*   Methods for using AI tools in project planning, coding, debugging, testing, documentation, build scripts, database creation, content creation and more.
*   Guidelines and best practices for working with AI tools.
*   Limitations and potential pitfalls of AI tools.
*   Reasons for any setbacks, and why a fully functional “A-Life Challenge” was or was not completed.

## Team Collaboration
This project is a collaborative effort, and we are using Git and Github for version control. We will be using a feature-branch workflow, and you should not work directly in the main branch.

### Setting up the Repository
1.  **Clone the main repository:** `git clone <repository_url>` [See previous conversation].
2.  **Create a new feature branch** from the main branch for each new feature or set of changes: `git checkout -b <feature_branch_name>` [See previous conversation].

### Workflow for Feature Development
1.  Make changes on your **feature branch**.
2.  **Commit** your changes with clear and descriptive messages.
3.  **Push** your feature branch to the remote repository: `git push origin <feature_branch_name>`.
4.  Create a **pull request** to merge your feature branch into the main branch.
5.  **Review** and **merge** the pull request after discussion and approval.

### Developer Diaries
Each team member should maintain a developer diary, potentially in the form of a blog. This diary should include:
*   Prompts used with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT).
*   Output from AI tools.
*   Reflections on the quality and usefulness of the interactions with AI tools.

These diaries will be combined into a single document for the final paper.

## Technologies
The project uses the following technologies:
*   **Python**: Overall language
*   **Pygame**: Interactive components of the simulation
*   **NumPy**: Efficient calculations
*   **Deap**: Evolutionary algorithm
*   **configparser**: Customizable starting configuration
*   **Pandas**: Statistical data analysis
*   **HDF5**: Complex data storage
*   **JSON**: Lightweight data storage
*  **ChatGPT/Copilot/Gemini**: planning, boilerplate code, debugging
*  **Docker**: system agnostic simulation deployment
*   **Git/Github**: Version control and collaborative development

## Project Deliverables
*   A fully functional (or partially functional) **A-Life Challenge** application, that meets the requirements defined in the project plan.
*   A **comprehensive report** on the methods, guidelines, limitations, and pitfalls of using AI tools in software development.
*   A detailed **developer diary** from each team member that includes notes about each of the AI tools used in the project.
*   A combined final paper summarizing the team's findings.

## Conclusion
This project aims to explore the potential of AI in software development while creating an interesting simulation. While creating the "A-Life Challenge" application is a goal, the most important outcome is the documentation and analysis of our experiences with AI tools. This project will provide valuable insights into the possibilities of AI-assisted development and help to develop best practices for future projects.
